### What is cloud computing?
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet. Some examples are virtual machines, databases, and networking.

### Advantages of using the cloud

- Saves space
- Less responsibility (don't have to install security for physical infrastructure, like cameras and security guards. Don't have to worry about power and cooling.)
- Easy to set up
